			<h1> Leage of Legends, ELO climb </h1>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Hello, im Franz Flemming and you can find me on the EUW servers. Im writing a guide how i climbed my way up the elo ladder. Im currently Gold 1, and i may not be ranked super high, but i have made progress on the elo ladder, and that's whats matter, and this guide is also directed more at lower ranked players (ofcourse higher ranked players can also benefit of this guide, but im unexperienced at the higher ranks than my own).<br><br>

			I have played League, for about two years now, but my interest in ranked plays is fairly new. My ranked journey Started in silver 5, i began duo queueing with one of my friends, and we reached silver 1. But then i lost my interest in ranked plays, and didnt played for a while, and i was demoted to silver 3. More recently i have started playing ranked again, and now i have reached gold 1, and towards my way to plat.<br><br>

			Reached plat 19-01-14 :)
			Changed name to Captian fabulous (i know it's typed wrong, but didnt see the mistake before i changed the name '-_-)
			currently plat 1, with 64 lp, so im very close to diamond :D!<br><br>

			But enough about me.</p>

			<h2>Before the game, Mindset, and dealing with flamers</h2>
			<p>The first thing before your game, is to have the right mindset. Always try to stay positive, dont go into a game, thinking that you will end up with noobs, feeder, afk etc. and loose.<br><br>

			Look out for you mistakes, and try to improve them. For example if you are mid, and you enemy laner, going towards botlane, your teammates get killed, and you say it's their fault for overextending and not warding. But you could maybe follow the enemy laner, and saved the botlane, or maybe even getting a kill. But this is just an example, the point is too improve your mistakes, and when something bad happens you should think: was there anything i could help it, or prevent it?<br><br>

			Before you going into the game, you should always try to keep a good attitude, and your players are more likely to have a good attitude over for you. And when the relationship with your teammates is good, you are more likely to win.<br><br>

			And dont ever flame, it will bring you nothing good, and only increase you chances to loose. if one of you're teammates is flaming on you, or another teammate, either ignore him, or convince him too stop flaming. You could say: Stop flaming, it wont help us win. You will be suprised how many actually stop flaming, and sometimes even apologize. Though not always the flamers will listen, and then your only option is too ignore. And never, ever flame back, as said it will only make the situation worse.</p>
