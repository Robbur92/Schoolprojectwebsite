				<h2> The game </h2>
				
				World of Warcraft is a mmorpg (Massive-multiplayer-online-roleplayingame. 
				It came out in 2004, as of 2014 the game has almost 7 million subscribers. 
				The world is divided into five different zones; Azeroth, Kalimdor, Northerend, Pandaria og Outlands. <br><br>

				<a name="Realms"></a>
				<h4>Realms:</h4>
					- PvP – Player vs. Player – On these servers the players are able to attack each other when they meet in-game, No exceptions. The only thing is that they need to be on the opposite side from the person they are attacking. <br>
					- PvE – Player vs. Environment – On these servers the player are not able to attack each other unless the players have manually turned on PVP and the other player also have done so. But they can still fight each other if they queue up for eighter arena matches with is 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5 or battleground wich is from 10v10 to 40v40.<brZ
					- RP – Role-Playing – On these servers the players take their looks and behaviour really serious. They often walk slowly with their character instead of running so it is more like the real life. They also use much time crafting clothes which suites their character better according to looks, than the gear/ clothes that they can get from vendors or monsters while playing. These kind of servers do have the same PVP terms as the PvE servers.<br> <br>
				<a name="Mounts"></a>
				<h4>Mounts</h4>
					Since the world in World of Warcraft is so huge, there are multiple ways of getting around. You can go to a flightmaster and pay a fee for traveling from one place to another. You can jump on one of the ships, for the Alliance, or zeppelins, for the Horde, and travel across the big ocean from one continent to another. It is also possible to fly around on your own mount when you have reached maximum level. Before that you can either sit on a ground mount, or if you are really low level, run on the ground with your bare feet. 
				<a name="Auction House"></a>
				<h4>Auction House</h4>
					Auction House is a place where players can sell items to other players. 
					The prices depend on which server the character is on. The prices of AH is only managed by supply and demand like in real life 

				<br>
				<br>
				<a name="In-game definitions"></a>

				<a name="Classes"></a>
				<h2> Classes</h2>
					Each class in the game has tree or four sub-classes which they have to choose one the specialize in. 
				<h4>Warrior</h4>
					Uses platearmor and consumes rage to execute abilities. Is only melee ranged, and cannot do any magical damage.<br><br>
				<strong>Arms</strong> <br>
					The arms warrior is a character which is hybrid between the protection and fury warrior. It have den ability to use twohand weapons, two onehand weapons and one shield and a onehand weapon. The arms warrior does have many abilities which it shares with at least one of the two other subclasses.  
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Protection</strong> <br>
					This is a tank subclass. It have more stamina, health, then the other two subclasses. It uses a onehand weapon such as a small axe, and a shield to defend it self. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Fury</strong> <br>
					This a DPS class which use lots of bleed abilities, the target bleed over a set time. DoT damage. It can choose between one- and twohand weapons.
				<br>
				<br> 
				<h4>Warlock</h4>
					The warlock is a special class. All the three subclasses are ranged dps, and uses the same source to be able to execute abilities, mana. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Destruction</strong><br>
					The destruction warlock uses spells to make lots of damage over a short period of time. This is a class which is really powerful, and do great in PvP.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Demonology</strong><br>
					This subclass have multiple pets and companions which fight for it, and also uses AoE spells to take down enemies. This class can, depending on the pets, also tank in some situations. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Affliction</strong><br>
					Affliction warlocks use spells which do DoT to kill enemies. Both this sbuclass and the Demonology class is good for use in PvE, on the contrary to Destruction Warlocks. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<h4>Paladin</h5> 
					Paladins are one of three classes which can have DPS, tank and healer spec. They can use all types of armor. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Retribution</strong> <br>
					The retribution paladin is much like the protection paladin, but are not able to use shield, and does not have the abilities to rise it's threat level like the protection paladin. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Protection</strong> <br>
					The Paladin tank is a lot different from the warrior and the Druid. The paladin use holy magic, consuming mana, together with physical contact to hold the threat level high. The paladin can put out AoE, area of effects, spells on the ground which make all the creatures inside the area attack it. Uses a shield to block as much attacks as possible, and keep it's health level up.  
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Holy</strong> <br>
					The paladin healer is different from the other classes with healing abilities. Most of the other healers use cloth armor, with make them very vulnerable to melee damage since the armor don't protect as much as the thicker types such as plate which the paladin use. Since it's able to protect itself better from melee attackers, it is more suited for healing in close combats. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<h4>Monk</h4>
					This is the master of martial arts in the game. It uses leather armor, and mostly fist weapons. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Brewmaster</strong> <br>
					Use it’s bear hands to attack, only use weapon to finish a enemy. Places a totem on the ground which generate threat from the creatures around.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Mistweaver</strong> <br>
					This subclass is the weakest subclass. The other healertypes often tend to “outheal” the Mistweaver with 40% or more. This make the monk only really usable as a DPS or tank. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Windwalker</strong> <br>
					The windwalker is a class that waits until the target have taken some damage, and then use lots of force to take them down. Like the Destruction Warlock it does massive amount of damage over a short period of time. If it don't kill it's enemy it have to wait until it's able to does much damage again. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<h4>Mage</h4>
					The mage is a powerful caster which can cause much damage to the surroundings, but can’t handle much damage from others. It uses cloth armor. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Frost</strong> <br>
					Frost mages are good for questing, pvp, and crowd control. They also have the highest survival rate of any other spec due to their ability to control other creatures for a short period of time. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Fire</strong> <br>
					Fire mages are a god class to deal AoE to multiple targets at the time. They can also cast their spells while they move, which is different from the other to classes. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Arcane</strong> <br>
					The Arcane mage is the glass cannon, with its thin cloth armor it can’t handle much physical damage to itself, but it can deal lot and lots of damage to the enemy. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<h4>Shaman</h4>
					The shaman is a class which rely on the powers of the elements; air, water, fire and nature. It uses leather armor. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Elemental</strong> <br>
					The elemental shaman is a class that use AoE and take down the enemy over time like some of the other casters. The shaman use totems to boost itself and gain more power from the elements around. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Enhancement</strong> <br>
					Enhancement shaman is a different class from all the others. It uses mana like many of the other classes in the game, but also uses the power from the elements and totems to deal damage. When it attack it surround it's weapon with elemental power and then strike. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Restoration</strong> <br>
					This healertype is good when on a place where the healer can stand in one place all the time, or move just a bit. This is because like the two other shaman classes, it uses elemental power from totems. To place these totems it needs mana. If the healer need to put out totems all the time, it will run out of mana. It is also special in a way that it heals placing AoE on the ground healing everyone inside the circle.  
				<br>
				<br> 
				<h4>Death Knight</h4>
					The Death Knight is rather special. Instead of starting to level from level 1, you start at level 55. It does only melee damage, and can wear plate armor.
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Blood</strong> <br>
					This is the strongest class in-game as of pre-release of WoD. It is really good at keeping the threat level on itself, and does not require lots of healing from the healer. It's has huge self-heals, which makes it really good in PvP especially. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Frost</strong> <br>
					This class is also a very powerful class, but doesn't have the ability to heal itself like the Blood Death Knight. It does frostdamage to the enemy, and the damagepattern is like som of the casters, lot of damage over a short period of time. Uses runic power instead of mana, or other powers. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Unholy</strong> <br>
					The only difference between the Frost and Unholy Death Knight is the damage pattern. Unholy poison and infects its target to do damage over time. It also places curses in chosen areas by the player, to do more damage. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
 				<h4>Hunter</h4>
					The hunter is a class that don’t handle physical damage dealt to itself very well even though it can wear mail armor. It uses “Focus” as their powersource.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Marksmanhsip</strong> <br>
					This type of hunter is a master archer or sharpshooter who excels in bringing down enemies from afar. It's vulnerable to melee attacks, and therefor need to take out the enemy before it reaches it. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Survival</strong> <br>
					This hunter uses venom, traps and explosives to take down its enemies. The venom does damage over time, and the traps can slow down or stop the enemy from moving/ attacking. 
				<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Beast Mastery</strong> <br>
					The beast master hunter is a special class. It can tame wild beasts it counter in the game, and use them as its own pets. This class can also tank for a short period of time if it has a strong pet like a bear or similar because the pet will be the thing the enemy will attack.  
				<br> 
				<br> 
				<h4>Rogue</h4>
					Rogues are the sneaky class of the game. They take advantage of the shadows and use small daggers to assassinate their enemies. They deal lots of damage, but are vulnerable to damage due to their leather armor. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Assassination</strong> <br>
					This is the rogueclass that does damage over time. It poison its target with multiple venoms. The poisonous effect lasts longer and does more damage with each combo point that the rogue have saved. Each attack from the rogue grants a combo point, except auto-attacks. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Combat</strong> <br>
					This rogue stand right in front of its enemy and do as much damage as it can. No hiding, poison or backstabbing, only straight out fighting face-to-face. It uses combo points like the the two others, and energy as power fro its abilities. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Subtlety</strong> <br>
					This is the “shadow” rogue. It starts its combats in the shadows, attack someone and become visible, and then hide again. The attacks of this rogue does more damage if used hidden, and in the back of the enemy. 
				<br> 
				<br> 
 				<h4>Priest</h4>
					The priest and the mage is not that different when dealing damage, and their cloth armor, but that’s it. While mages only can do damage, the priest can heal aswell, making it a good class if you want to change your role in the game once in a while. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Shadow</strong> <br>
					This is the DoT champion of the game. It basically stun/ mind control you and kill you. But need to stand still to cast spells, so much moving around should do the trick. It uses dark magic when it transforms into its special shadowform. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Discipline</strong> <br>
					This is a hybrid class. It works both as a healer and a ranged DPS. It has all the abilities that the shadow pries has without the spells that require shadowform. It also have some of the healing abilities that the holy priest have, but not all. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Holy</strong> <br>
					This is a very powerful healer. It can place a shield at a wounded player for a given time, and heal another at the same time. The only major problem with the holy priest is that it does only have cloth armor, which mean that it can't handle much physical attacks from melee players.  
				<br> 
				<br>  
 				<h4>Druid</h4> This is the only class in the game which have all the four types of playmodes in the game, and can do well in all of them. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Feral</strong> <br>
					This class make you attack formed like a big cat. This class is very powerful and does very well in PvP, but not as good in PvE due to the lack of health. It attacks with much power over a longer period of time than many other classes.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Guardian</strong> <br>
					This is tank class that transforms the player into a bear. It share some of the features it have from the warrior. Like the fact that they use rage as their powersource. They are both very good to keep threat level, but not as good when multiple targets are attacking at the same time. 
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Balance</strong> <br>
					This is yet another powerful caster. And like all the other druids it has a shapeshift form. This is really special, you transform into a walking owl-like creature with horns.  All the druid classes have more transformation possibilities. Like the travelform, a bird when allowed to fly, a aquatic form  when in water and a reindeer when not allowed to fly while on the ground.
				<br> 
				<br>
				<strong>Restoration</strong> <br>
					This is a healer with mixed power. It is very powerful when it's in the shapeshiftform looking like a tree, but is on the lower side of the scale when looking like normal. Its healing is based on healing-over-time, making huge health-drop critical, but effective in the long run.
